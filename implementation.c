    See file memory.c on how to compile this code.

    Implement the functions __malloc_impl, __calloc_impl,
    __realloc_impl and __free_impl below. The functions must behave
    like malloc, calloc, realloc and free but your implementation must
    of course not be based on malloc, calloc, realloc and free.

    Use the mmap and munmap system calls to create private anonymous
    memory mappings and hence to get basic access to memory, as the
    kernel provides it. Implement your memory management functions
    based on that "raw" access to user space memory.

    As the mmap and munmap system calls are slow, you have to find a
    way to reduce the number of system calls, by "grouping" them into
    larger blocks of memory accesses. As a matter of course, this needs
    to be done sensibly, i.e. without wasting too much memory.

    You must not use any functions provided by the system besides mmap
    and munmap. If you need memset and memcpy, use the naive
    implementations below. If they are too slow for your purpose,
    rewrite them in order to improve them!

    Catch all errors that may occur for mmap and munmap. In these cases
    make malloc/calloc/realloc/free just fail. Do not print out any 
    debug messages as this might get you into an infinite recursion!

    Your __calloc_impl will probably just call your __malloc_impl, check
    if that allocation worked and then set the fresh allocated memory
    to all zeros. Be aware that calloc comes with two size_t arguments
    and that malloc has only one. The classical multiplication of the two
    size_t arguments of calloc is wrong! Read this to convince yourself:

    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=853906

    In order to allow you to properly refuse to perform the calloc instead
    of allocating too little memory, the __try_size_t_multiply function is
    provided below for your convenience.

   defining a certain struct, a typedef and a global variable holding
   the start of a linked list of currently free memory blocks. That
